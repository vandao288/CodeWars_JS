# CodeWars_JS
For my practice in JavaScript with CodeWars kyu
Each filename will be of this format: shortDescription_kyu
The top part of each file will be question's content, description, examples of input & output. 
Sometimes pseudocode could be included in the top comments.
Status of each code will be update in git commit.
